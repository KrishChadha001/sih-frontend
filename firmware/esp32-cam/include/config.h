// Capture settings. FRAMESIZE_VGA (640x480) is a solid default - small,
// fast to upload, plenty of resolution for the model (which resizes to
// 224x224 anyway - see frontend/server/app/cv/real_frame_processor.py,
// so going higher than VGA mostly just makes uploads slower for detail
// the model discards). Bump to FRAMESIZE_SVGA/XGA only if a real test
// against the actual container shows the model needs more detail.

// Image tuning - auto exposure/white-balance stay on by default (most
// robust across real lighting variation, and likely closest to how the
// training photos were casually captured). Brightness/contrast/
// saturation default to sensor-neutral (0) - if real photos of the
// actual container look over/under-exposed or washed out, use the
// live-preview tool (swap in src/camera_web_server.cpp.txt - see its
// header comment) to find values that look right against the real
// mounting/lighting, then set them here. Range for all three is -2..2.
